This MOD is for those wanting that NEW live Idler setup, But without reprinting your whole motion system!

These modified XY joints will be all you need to have the best of BOTH worlds!

NOW with added Kat for that sweet Kitty Goodness!
ive also tweaked the design slightly! - hope you like them!

They have been designed to re-use the M3x25 screw and Threaded insert to now hold the top and bottom parts together (rather than the M2 self-tapping screw) for a strong connection.
this is also accessible from the top making maintenance a breeze as you can just un-screw and lift the tops off to gain access to the bearing stacks!

Additional parts requiredâ€¦

2 off 3mm dia x 30mm long pins
2 off solid Gates 16 tooth idlers

there are 2 printed Jigs to aid in setting the solid idlers in the correct place on your pins
(just make sure not to mix them up as they are different)

you'll also need some joining compound - Loctite 638 is a good one to use
this ensures a good bond between the pin and idlers to stop them from moving / spinning on the pins.
